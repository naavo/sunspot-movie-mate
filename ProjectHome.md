We intend to build a SunSpot project where the SPOTs would act as a remote for watching a movie on a lap top.
Initial goals would be
1. A horizontal movement to mimic a forward or back up feature
2. A vertical movement mimicking a volume control
3. May be the switches for Pause or Stop functionality of the movie.
